I am interested in the **structural dynamics of macromolecules**.


I enjoy revisiting or designing experimental methods that yield structural information beyond the static picture, be they in the transient or steady-state regimes. The process I follow is rooted in a rigorous examination of the theoretical principles underpinning the physical processes at play. 


I also enjoy devising modeling tools that help generate working hypothesis. 


I am increasingly concerned with the potential “real-life” outcome of my work, and started to factor that aspect in my working routine.
