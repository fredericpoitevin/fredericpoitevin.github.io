I am interested in the **structural dynamics of macromolecules**.


I enjoy revisiting or designing experimental methods that yield structural information beyond the static picture, be they in the transient or steady-state regimes. The process I follow is rooted in a rigorous examination of the theoretical principles underpinning the physical processes at play. 


I also enjoy devising modeling tools that help generate working hypothesis. 


I am increasingly concerned with the potential “real-life” outcome of my work, and started to factor that aspect in my working routine.


The aim of this website is for me to share aspects of my research and how they are related. I will distinguish between *Projects* and *Methods*: the former will present my work on a specific topic as it evolves, making use of possibly several methodological approaches, while the latter will try at giving a more general idea of the methods used and/or developed. It could of course happen that a Project and a Method share the same title...
