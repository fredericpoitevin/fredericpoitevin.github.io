  <h1 class="page-heading">Welcome</h1>

  Welcome! I will use this place to explain how aspects of my research fit in the broader context that is "we need to see life's building blocks in action".<br>

  I currently work in the field of structural biology, that part of biology focusing on the mechanics of the living cell, a task that includes performing a thorough inventory of its components, describing what they look like and how they move, as well as how they interact with one another.<br>

  For the most part, I have been working on describing molecules that were extracted out from the cell prior to measuring stuff on them, like imaging how the atoms that make them are assembled in space, and how they work collectively to provide the whole molecule with an array of motions that it might likely use to carry out its "function" in the cellular context. Think of enzymes catalyzing chemical reactions by munching on small chemical compounds swimming around in a pac-man way...
